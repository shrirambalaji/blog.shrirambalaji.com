I've been reading about stages of Rust compilation, and wrote about some of my learnings in a [previous post](https://blog.shrirambalaji.com/posts/resolving-rust-symbols/). As I started reading more, I realized that it might be helpful to find a way to contribute to the project, learn more about the compiler and validate my assumptions / understanding of the compiler.

## Finding an issue to work on

The `rustc` compiler is a large codebase, and definitely intimidating at first glance. As with contributing to any new OSS project, I started by looking at the issues that were tagged as beginner friendly and found an issue that was tagged as `E-mentor` and `E-easy`: [#129599](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/129599).

It involved adding a new `std_features` flag to the bootstrap phase of the compiler, that helps in enabling `std` features for compiler development. This could be features like enabling `panic-unwind` or `backtrace` features when building the compiler.

This felt like a good issue to start with, and it was relatively straightforward to understand the issue, but I had to understand how the compiler was bootstrapped and how the `std_features` flag was passed to the compiler.

I also connected with [`Onur Ozkan`](https://onurozkan.dev) who was the mentor for the issue on zulip chat, and he was very helpful and welcoming throughout the process. Thanks Onur!

## What's bootstrapping?

Bootstrapping is how the compiler compiles itself, typically by using an older version to build a newer version. For rust to bootstrap, it has 4 stages:

<ThemedImage
	alt="Rust Bootstrap Stages"
	src={"/attachments/rust-bootstrap-stages.svg"}
	darkSrc={"/attachments/rust-bootstrap-stages-dark.svg"}
></ThemedImage>

- Stage 0: Pre-compiled Compiler - the current beta `rustc` and is downloaded from the internet.
- Stage 1: Compiler built with the pre-compiled compiler from Stage 0
- Stage 2: Rebuilding the stage 1 compiler with itself, and this is what get's distributed with `rustup`.
- Stage 3 (optional): We can build libs with this compiler to sanity check that the compiler result is the same as the stage 2 compiler.

The [Rustc Dev Guide on Bootstrapping](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/bootstrapping/what-bootstrapping-does.html) has a lot more details on bootstrapping, if you're interested in learning more.

## Getting started

I followed the steps in the [Quick Start](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/how-to-build-and-run.html#quick-start) guide on my macOS machine, and I ran into my first issue:

The `./x.py setup` command failed with the following error:

```

It looked like the build failed because the dependencies couldn't be compiled. Initially, I thought that I had some system dependencies missing, but later found out that it was because of conflicting system dependencies. I had `binutils` installed via `brew` and I had `strip` in my path, which was conflicting with the `strip` that was being used by the compiler.

So I had to remove `binutils` from my path, and then the build was successful:

```shell
brew uninstall binutils
```

### What's that python script doing in my rust compiler?

Wait a minute - why's there a python script to build the compiler? ðŸ¤”

`x.py` is a wrapper script that calls into the `bootstrap` tool - a cross-platform build tool backed by `cargo`, used specifically for the rust project. `x.py` by itself doesn't do a lot more, other than checking for the python version and subsequently invoking the `bootstrap.py` script, which does the following:

- Parses the CLI arguments and passes it on the `bootstrap` tool
- Downloads the rust toolchain, and makes sure that the necessary build tools `rustc`, `cargo` etc., are available.
- Runs the bootstrap build using `cargo` to compile the bootstrap tool in `src/bootstrap`. The CLI arguments from earlier are passed to the `bootstrap` tool.
- Finally, the `bootstrap` tool is run with the CLI arguments.

So when we call `./x <subcommand>`, it's actually invoking the `bootstrap` CLI with the subcommand.

:::note
I understand the convenience of having a python script to wrap the build process, but it was a bit surprising at first. Also it does seem like Python is preferred for build scripts that run in CI, and it's not overused. There's a discussion to purge python, and over time it seems like a lot of the python scripts have been replaced. https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/110479

## Setting up Zed for Compiler Development

I've started using Zed for all of my personal work and I've been liking it a lot.

<div class="tweet-embed">
	<Tweet id="1847665535502213165" />
</div>

`./x setup` has an option to add settings to configure VSCode, but not for Zed. This is important for `rust_analyzer` to work correctly during compiler development. The configuration for `rust_analyzer` is not very different from VSCode, but needs to be added in a `.zed/settings.json` in the root of the repo:

```json title=".zed/settings.json"
{
	"lsp": {
		"rust-analyzer": {
			"initialization_options": {
				"check": {
					"invocationLocation": "root",
					"invocationStrategy": "once",
					"overrideCommand": ["python3", "x.py", "check", "--json-output"]
				},
				"linkedProjects": [
					"Cargo.toml",
					"src/tools/x/Cargo.toml",
					"src/bootstrap/Cargo.toml",
					"src/tools/rust-analyzer/Cargo.toml",
					"compiler/rustc_codegen_cranelift/Cargo.toml",
					"compiler/rustc_codegen_gcc/Cargo.toml"
				],
				"rustfmt": {
					"overrideCommand": ["./build/host/rustfmt/bin/rustfmt", "--edition=2021"]
				},
				"procMacro": {

					},
					"sysrootSrc": "./library",
					"extraEnv": {
						"RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP": "1"
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

:::note
There's an open issue to add a step for setting Zed for compiler dev, and I just assigned it to myself to get it fixed: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/126931
:::

## Making the change

The change involved a couple of steps:

- Adding a new field `std_features` in the `config.toml` file
- Parsing (deduplicated) and updating the internal rust `features` config to be passed on the compiler bootstrap process
- Unit tests

```toml title="config.toml"
[rust]
# other options for compiling rust . . .
std-features = ["panic_unwind"]
```

### How does bootstrap read the `config.toml` file?

Bootstrap uses [toml-rs](https://crates.io/crates/toml) to parse the `config.toml`. Also since configuration can be overridden from both the `toml` file and from command line arguments, the `TomlConfig` struct implements a `Merge` trait:

```rust

/// Denotes how the config needs to be merged, specifically when handling duplicates.
enum ReplaceOpt {
    /// Silently ignore a duplicated value
    IgnoreDuplicate,
    /// Override the current value, even if it's `Some`
    Override,
    /// Exit with an error on duplicate values
    ErrorOnDuplicate,
}

impl Merge for TomlConfig {
    fn merge(
        &mut self,
		// other options from `TomlConfig` are also required here
        TomlConfig { rust }: Self,
        replace: ReplaceOpt,
    ) {
        fn do_merge<T: Merge>(x: &mut Option<T>, y: Option<T>, replace: ReplaceOpt) {
            if let Some(new) = y {
                if let Some(original) = x {
                    original.merge(new, replace);
                } else {
                    *x = Some(new);
                }
            }
        }
        do_merge(&mut self.rust, rust, replace);
		// merge other fields in `TomlConfig` . . .
    }
}
```

The config fields are not directly decoded, but decoded into separate sections represented by their own [`struct`](https://github.com/shrirambalaji/rust/blob/8b968764f15ea84b389b2af98297b9d30fb9952e/src/bootstrap/src/core/config/config.rs#L1101). In my case, I only needed to add a field in the `Rust` struct, corresponding to the `[rust]` section in the `config.toml` [here](https://github.com/shrirambalaji/rust/blob/8b968764f15ea84b389b2af98297b9d30fb9952e/src/bootstrap/src/core/config/config.rs#L1156).

### Deduplicating `std_features`

Although the previous step handled merging, since we are dealing with a list of values there needed to be some way to deduplicate it, because the internal `features` representation needs to be based on that.

I reached for the handy [`HashSet`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashSet.html) collection, but from the review I understood that the order of `std_features` could be important, and the current implementation works with this assumption. `HashSet` does not have deterministic ordering and so I cannot use it, this is because it's backed by a hashtable and needs to be compute the hashcode for every element and then puts it in a "bucket". The bucket has no connection to the insertion order, so there's no way to keep track of the insertion order.

So I implemented it with a [`BTreeSet`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeSet.html) instead as suggested in the initial review.

### Error Handling in CI Builds

The `toml` parser handles parsing errors by default, so I didn't have to do anything there. Since the `std_features` option can fundamentally change the output of the compiler, we need to throw an error if this config gets passed in CI builds. I really liked the `err` macro that they had setup for making this easy.

```rust
macro_rules! err {
  ($current:expr, $expected:expr) => {
      if let Some(current) = &$current {
          if Some(current) != $expected.as_ref() {
              return Err(format!(
                  "ERROR: Setting `llvm.{}` is incompatible with `llvm.download-ci-llvm`. \
                  Current value: {:?}, Expected value(s): {}{:?}",
                  stringify!($expected).replace("_", "-"),
                  $current,
                  if $expected.is_some() { "None/" } else { "" },
                  $expected,
              ));
          };
      };
  };
}
```

I usually stay away from macros (skill issue tbh), but I liked this one. I'm still contemplating if this could have been a function, but I digress.

### Merging the change - Squashing commits

I addressed all the feedback comments, and the PR was ready for merge. The rust project follows a rebase + squash workflow for contributors. I have had my own reservations about rebase in the past:

<div class="tweet-embed">
	<Tweet id="1769207470814269687" />
</div>

I learnt that most of my pain with rebase was probably due to not knowing about [`rerere`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rerere) which solved a lot of issues dealing with rebase merge conflicts.

However, squashing was new to me and the first time around I botched the squash and messed up the branch. Since it was also a rebase and I pushed upstream, there was no way to undo it (maybe there's a way, but I gave up pretty quickly).

So I made a new branch, rebased upstream onto it and cherry-picked my changes from the previous changes, and then squashed all of them into a single commit after following through this [article](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/git-squash).

Finally, after a couple of weeks of picking up my first issue, I got my first PR merged - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/131315. This might all sound trivial, but hey - I would not have imagined me being able to contribute to the rust project a couple of years ago, it's good to count the small wins! https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/1.83.0/ now lists me as a contributor ðŸ˜„

See you in the next one ðŸ‘‹
