I've been using [hashnode.dev](https://hashnode.dev) for the last couple of years as my primary blogging platform. It has served me well, but I think it's time for a change.

## Why I'm moving away from hashnode?

Don't get me wrong, hashnode is great to get started and helps build a habit of writing. But over time I've realized that I don't really write a lot, but when I do - I want it to look the way I want. Let me explain.

### Custom CSS is difficult to maintain

Hashnode had custom CSS for a couple of years, and I've raved about in the past.

<div class="tweet-embed">
	<Tweet id="https://twitter.com/shrirambalaji/status/1341662028843241474" />
</div>

But over time, as it happens with custom stylesheets - _things broke_. The theming was inconsistent with my site at [shrirambalaji.com](https://shrirambalaji.com) and it was hard to maintain. In hindsight, I should have realized that adding custom stylesheets without having any form of guarantee of it not breaking, would eventually turn out to be an issue.

I remember spending a couple of days to get it to match my theme when I first set it up, but that was mainly because I couldn't find extensive theming options on hashnode, and felt it to be limiting. (whether or not I write often - atleast the site should look consistent 😅)

Another slightly tangential issue was with code highlighting. I didn't particularly like the highlighting theme, and also the code theme didn't switch when going from Dark to Light.

### Lack of control on initial load performance

Around `760ms` was being spent on just fonts, and I couldn't do anything about it 🙁

> This isn't a post to dunk on hashnode - I know that it's a small team doing incredible work!

I also had some interesting things I wanted to try and building a blog felt like the perfect playground:

- I've started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as my primary way to write down notes. I wanted to experiment with this for publishing blogs from anywhere.
- I've tried Astro for some projects, but wanted to try it out since their 3.0 release. [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) also seemed like a great way to manage content.

## The Process

- Export documents from hashnode
- Setup Astro, (preferably use a starter)
- Update theming, setup syntax highlighting (shiki) with support for theme switching
- Setup Obsidian-Git Sync

## Exporting Documents from Hashnode

I originally expected exports to be markdown files, but to my surprise it was a json dump of all my articles. Fortunately, hashnode has a nifty Github Backup integration that backed up all my articles as markdown files. Neat!

## Setting up Astro

Since I wanted to move over things quickly and not spend a lot of time crafting the blog, a astro starter / theme was of essence. After searching a bit on [Astro's Theme Search](https://astro.build/themes/?search=&categories%5B%5D=blog), I found an opinionated starter that I liked - [Astro Theme Cactus by Chris Williams](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus).

### Features

The feature list was exactly what I was looking for, and also supported **View Transitions** ✨

- Astro v3.0
- View Transitions from [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/)
- TailwindCSS with Dark / Light Mode support
- Accessible, semantic HTML markup, responsive & SEO-friendly
- [Astro Assets Integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/assets/) for optimised images
- MD & [MDX](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-only-features) posts
- [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori) for creating open graph png images
- Pagination
- [Automatic RSS feed](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/rss)
- Shiki code syntax styling
- Auto-generated [sitemap](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/sitemap/)
- [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) static search library integration
- [Astro Icon](https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon) svg icon component

### Theming and Code Highlighting

Since my portfolio was also on tailwind, it was pretty straightforward to port styles. I just had to update a couple of `css-variables` and replace the fonts to use `Inter` (probably the best font ever, thanks [@rsms](https://twitter.com/rsms)). I still had to make some more stylistic changes to make the starter attuned to my liking (changing the appearance of tags, switching from a monospace font to sans-serif font for readability etc.,)

But, I ran into some troubles with code highlighting. The default Astro + Shiki configuration didn't allow me to switch code themes.

> Shiki generates themes at build time, client-side theme switching support is not built in.

However, Shiki supports adding CSS Variables that allow to customize tokens in a theme individiually, and then changing those variables for light & dark theme.

### Shikiji to the rescue

[Shikiji](https://github.com/antfu/shikiji), a pure ESM focused rewrite of Shiki has native support for dark-light mode theme switching. [Nate Moore](https://twitter.com/n_moore) who co-created astro suggested using this as an alternative to using CSS variables with Astro + Shiki in their discord community. Thanks Nate!

```bash
$ pnpm add rehype-shikiji
```

We need to disable the astro's in-built `shiki` syntax highlighting by setting it to `false`, and configure `rehype-shikiji` as a plugin in `astro.config.mjs`.

```js
export default defineConfig({
	markdown: {
		syntaxHighlight: false,
		rehypePlugins: [
			[
				shikiji,
				{
					themes: {
						light: "github-light",
						dark: "github-dark",
					},
				},
			],
		],
	})
```

Voila! We have beautiful syntax highlighting that switches between dark & light.

## Publishing Blogs from Anywhere with Obsidian

I wanted to be able to draft articles from anywhere, and possibly turn this site into some sort of a digital garden. Obsidian has been amazing, I loved the idea of it being "local-first" and tbh **Obsidian was a breathe of fresh air, in a sea of notetaking apps.** I've been using it for a couple of years and as someone who never used to take notes - Obsidian has helped build a habit.

> Narrator: Can Obsidian help build a habit of writing blogs too, only time will tell.

### Obsidian Git & Plugins

[Obsidian-git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) is a plugin that supercharges an Obsidian vault with features like: auto backup, sync, pull, push, fetch, clone and treat any git repository as a vault.

For setting it up on the web, I followed this article [Fleeting Notes - Obsidian Git Setup](https://linked-blog-starter.vercel.app/connect-obsidian-vault-with-github). This was pretty straightforward to do, and I was able to set it up pretty quickly.

On mobile, I had some hiccups but [Obsidian Git - Mobile Docs](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Getting+Started#Clone+via+plugin) was pretty descriptive. I wanted to have only the `content` directory of this site, in an obsidian vault but that seemed impossible, so I just resorted to using the entire site as an obsidian vault.

As a workaround, I tried the [`File Hider`](https://github.com/Oliver-Akins/file-hider) plugin to hide the rest of the `src` folder. I wanted to write [`MDX`](https://mdxjs.com/) to use Astro components in my blogposts, so I also had to install [mdx-as-md](https://github.com/git-no/obsidian-markdown-file-suffix) which allows editing MDX files within Obsidian.

#### Auto Deploying with Vercel

Thanks to [vercel](https://vercel.com), anytime Obsidian-Git made a backup ie. stage, commit and push behind the scenes - the site gets auto-deployed with the latest changes. The fun part being - I don't even need access to my laptop for it.

Also, another cool thing in this starter is that it allows me to work on draft posts by setting `draft` to `true` in the frontmatter, which are viewable only in `DEV` mode.

```md
---
draft: true
---
```

### Running Pagespeed Insights

Ah, a perfect [100](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-blog-shrirambalaji-com/gcnypx9m5r?form_factor=mobile) 🥳. Isn't that a sight!

I'm fully aware that Lighthouse scores don't always reflect perceived user experience based on [many](https://calibreapp.com/blog/downsides-of-performance-score)
[writings](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/building-the-most-inaccessible-site-possible-with-a-perfect-lighthouse-score/)
but hey - gotta be happy with the 100.

You can view the source code for this blog on [GitHub](https://github.com/shrirambalaji/blog.shrirambalaji.com). It's open-source, so feel free to contribute to it, fork it (but do attribute it back).

**Astro** and the ecosystem around it has enabled me to make this change in a couple of days. 

Looking forward to write more here!
