Hello! I'm building [**linkerland**](https://github.com/shrirambalaji/linkerland) - a tool to parse and visualize linker map files. This is a devlog series where I'll be sharing my progress and learnings,  inspired by [Mitchell Hashimoto's Devlogs on Ghostty](https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-devlog-001)

## What is a `.map` file?

A [Linker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)) map file contains information about the memory layout of the program. It is efectively a map of the memory address offsets to variables and functions in a program.

A map file typically has these sections:
- Object files referenced in a program during linking
- Sections in the [ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) / [Mach-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach-O) / [COFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COFF) Object File formats.
- The *symbol table*, listing all the symbols in the program.

Here's a trimmed down example of a map file, generated by Clang / LD for a rust program on macOS:

```text title="macos-sample-rust-app.map"
# Path: /target/debug/deps/sample-app
# Arch: arm64
# Object files:
[ 66] /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX14.4.sdk/usr/lib/system/libunwind.tbd
# Sections:
# Address	Size    	Segment	Section
0x1000007DC	0x00036FC4	__TEXT	__text
# Symbols:
# Address	Size    	File  Name
0x10004C058	0x00000018	[  1] __ZN3std3sys3pal4unix17thread_local_dtor13register_dtor5DTORS17hf7230a0b661819a4E
```

The map file (generated by LLD) is divided into blocks, each block starting with a `#` followed by the name. The `# Symbols` block lists all the symbols in the program, along with their addresses and sizes. I'm calling it a "block" so as to not conflate it with "sections" in the ELF file format.

If you've read my previous blog on [Resolving Rust Symbols](/posts/resolving-rust-symbols) these terms might sound all too familiar. It's okay if you haven't read it, I have talked about these in the blog, so now is probably a good time to check it out!

## Why am I building this?

I wanted to parse the map files and take a peek into what the linker has done. The symbol tables from `.o` files, give us the outlook of the program at a file level. The map file could give us a bird's eye view of the entire program. (At least that's what I think 🤔)

I looked at [MapFileViewer](https://github.com/govind-mukundan/MapViewer) and it seems like a really good tool, but it's Windows specific. I wanted to build something similar for macOS and Linux. So here we are!

I'v read that firmware engineers working in embedded systems use map files for debugging. I don't have a lot of experience with embedded systems, but maybe this tool could be useful for them too.



## Writing a parser

I started by writing a [parser crate](https://github.com/shrirambalaji/linkerland/tree/main/crates/parser) for the map files. The parser would read the map file and give us a structured representation of the file. I haven't yet decided on the output format, could be an AST with a JSON representation or just simple structs.

As of now, I've started implementing the parser for macOS, and eventually will support Linux.

### Parser Generators vs Combinators

The most simplistic way to parse a map file is to use regular expressions. The popular [`mapfile_parser`](https://crates.io/crates/mapfile_parser) crate uses this approach, but I wanted to avoid regex matching.

I wanted to parse the file in a more structured way, and it also felt using regex could take a performance hit (but I didn't really measure it tbh 🤷‍♂️)

There are a couple of options:
* **Parser Generators** - Generates the parser code based on a grammar (`yacc`, `bison`, `antlr`, etc.)
* **Parser Combinators** - Write the parser code directly as high-level functions

I liked parser combinators because they are fairly easy to reason about and write. Functions written in parser combinators are composable and can be reused, and are also easy to test.

I also learnt that [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) is a parser generator, and powers the syntax highlighting of most modern code editors.

I've worked with parser generators in the past: built a parser for [KQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/general-development/keyword-query-language-kql-syntax-reference) that needed to work on the browser, using [`nearley`](https://nearley.js.org) during a work hackathon. It was fun, but wasn't particularly easy to test and never saw the light of day 😅

Atleast for my use case, parser combinators seemed like a good-enough choice, considering how the map files don't follow a specification unlike programming languages.

### Winnow vs Nom

**TLDR**: I chose `winnow` over `nom` because it's actively maintained and _faster_ according to [benchmarks](https://github.com/rosetta-rs/parse-rosetta-rs/).

I was also considering using [`yap`](https://github.com/jsdw/yap) which dev [tpot](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/tpot-postrat) would love, but hey can't always just be yapping amirite? 😜

:::note
<details>
<summary>Reasons for choosing `winnow` over `nom`</summary>

I used `nom` a couple of years ago for some Advent of Code challenges, and I faintly remember liking it.  I found out about `winnow` from [Adam Chalmers](https://twitter.com/adam_chal) video in [Zoo's Rust Club - How To Build Parsers](https://youtu.be/QF3kMyzMC40) and then learnt that the maintainer took a break, and `winnow` was a fork of `nom` that was actively maintained. The [benchmarks](https://github.com/rosetta-rs/parse-rosetta-rs/) also showed that `winnow` was faster than `nom`, so I decided to give it a spin.

If you want a history lesson on why `winnow` was built, here's a [blog](https://epage.github.io/blog/2023/02/winnow-toml-edit-combine-nom/) from the maintainer - Edward Page.

In the version of `nom` I was using, there was heavy use of macros which I disliked, as they usually take a compile-time hit, and also a _skill issue_ that I can't read and write macros very well (yet).

### Using Winnow

Let's take a snippet from the parser crate to look at how we write it using `winnow`.

Specifically, let's say we want to parse just the architecture from the map file. The architecture is usually the first line in the map file, and it looks something like this.

```text
# Arch: arm64
```

:::note
Architecture seems to be present only in the map files generated by `clang + ld` - the default system linker on macOS. I couldn't find it in the map files generated on linux by `gcc + ld`.
:::

```rust title="parser/src/lib.rs"
use winnow::{
    ascii::{multispace0, till_line_ending}
    combinator::preceded,
}

fn arch<'i>(input: &mut &'i str) -> PResult<&'i str> {
    preceded(
        literal("# Arch: "),
        preceded(multispace0, till_line_ending),
    )
    .parse_next(input)
}
```

The `arch` function takes an input string and returns the architecture. Every parser function in `winnow` should ideally return a [`PResult`](https://docs.rs/winnow/latest/winnow/error/type.PResult.html) which I think is short for "parser result" and can be either `Ok(O)` where O is parsed value or `Err(ErrMode<E>)`.

Then we use the `preceded` combinator to parse the text. The `preceded` combinator takes in two parsers as arguments, runs them sequentially, ignores the output of the first and returns the output of the second parser.

In our case, The first parser is `literal("# Arch: ")` which matches the literal string `# Arch: ` and the second parser takes  `till_line_ending` which matches everything till the end of the line, preceded by 0 or more whitespaces which is represented by `multispace0`.

Then we call [`parse_next`](https://docs.rs/winnow/latest/winnow/trait.Parser.html#tymethod.parse_next) on the parser to parse the input string. The `parse_next` function is a trait method that is implemented for all `winnow::Parser` types.

Okay! let's see how easy it is to test our `arch` parser.

```rust title="parser/src/lib.rs"
#[test]
fn test_arch() {
    let mut input = "# Arch: x86_64";
    let result = arch(&mut input);
    assert_eq!(result.unwrap(), "x86_64");
}
```

In a similar fashion, I've written parsers for other blocks in the map file like `sections`, `symbols`, `path`, etc. The bigger challenge is to make this work cross platform, but that's a problem for another day 😅

### Next Steps

- Finish up the parser for macOS
- Add output formats for the parsed data
- Think about how to visualize it
- Write the Linux implementation


See you in the next devlog! 👋
